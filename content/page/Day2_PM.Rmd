Try making a scatterplot of any two columns.

_Hint: Numeric variables will be more informative._

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = __column1__, y = __column2__)) + geom_point()
```
</div>


## Colors {-}
<hr class="hrlvl2">

Now let's use color to show the origins of the scrap
```{r, eval=T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = destination, y = credits, color = origin)) +
  geom_point()
```

<br>

This is a **A LOT** of detail. Let's make a bar chart and add up the sales to make it easier to understand.

```{r, eval = T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = destination, y = credits, fill = origin)) + geom_col()
```


>
> It's still tricky to compare sales by origin. Let's change the position of the columns.

```{r, eval = T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = destination, y = credits, fill = origin)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

1. Load one of the data sets below into R
    - Porg contamination on Ahch-To: "https://itep-r.netlify.com/data/porg_samples.csv"
    - Planet Endor air samples: "https://itep-r.netlify.com/data/air_endor.csv"
    - Or use data from a recent project of yours  

<br>
  
2. Create 2 plots using the data. 
3. _Don't worry if it looks_ __really weird__. _Consider it art and try again._  



<div class="note">
### <i class="fas fa-hand-spock"></i> Spock-tip! {-}

When you add more layers using `+` remember to place it at the end of each line.

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
# This will work
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = credits)) +
  geom_point()

# So will this
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = credits)) + geom_point()

# But this won't
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = credits))
  + geom_point()

```
</div>


# More Plots

## Colors {-}
<hr class="hrlvl2">

Now let's use color to show the destinations of the scrap.

```{r, eval=T, echo = T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = credits, color = destination)) +
  geom_point()
```

<br>


<div class="note">
### <i class="fas fa-hand-spock"></i> Spock-tip! {-}

One easy way to experiment with colors is to add layers like `scale_fill_brewer` or `scale_colour_brewer` to your plot which will link to RcolorBrewer palettes so you can have accessible color schemes.
</div>


## Bar charts {-}

This is way too much detail. Let's simplify and make a bar chart that adds up all the sales. Note that we use `fill=` inside `aes()` instead of `color=`. If we use color, we get a colorful outline and gray bars.


```{r, eval = T, echo = T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = credits, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col()
```

<br>

Let's change the position of the bars to make it easier to compare sales by destination for each origin? Remember, you can use `help(geom_col)` to learn about the different options for that plot. Feel free to do the same with other `geom_`'s as well.


```{r, eval = T, echo = T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = credits, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```


## Facet wrap {-}

Does the chart feel crowded to you? Let's use the `facet wrap` function to put each origin on a separate chart.

```{r, eval = T, echo = T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = credits, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap("destination")
```


## Themes {-}

You may not like the appearance of these plots. `ggplot2` uses `theme` functions to change the appearance of a plot. Try some.

```{r, eval = T, echo = T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = credits, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap("destination") +
  theme_bw()
```


## Labels {-}

You can also change the axis and title labels using the `labs` function.

```{r, eval = T, echo = T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = credits, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap("destination") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Scrap sales by origin and destination", 
       x     = "Origin", 
       y     = "Total sales")
```

<br>

## Drop `2.2e+06` scientific notation {-}

Want to get rid of that ugly scientific notation? We can use `options(scipen = 999)`. Note that this is a general setting in R. Once you use `options(scipen = 999)` in your current session, you don't have to use it again (like loading a package, you only need to run the line once when you start a new R session).

<br>

```{r, eval=T, echo=T}
options(scipen = 999)

ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = credits, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap("destination") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Scrap sales by origin and destination", 
       x     = "Origin", 
       y     = "Total sales")
```

<br>

<div class="tip">
### Challenge {-}

Let's say we don't like printing so many zeros and want the labels to be in __Millions__ of credits. Any ideas on how to make that happen?
</div>


<br>

<div class="tip">
### <i class="fa fa-user-astronaut" style="color: green;"></i> Explore! {-}

Be bold and make a __boxplot__. We've covered how to do a scatterplot with `geom_point` and a bar chart with `geom_col`, but how would you make a boxplot showing the prices at each destination? Feel free to experiment with `color` ,`facet_wrap`, `theme`, and `labs`.
