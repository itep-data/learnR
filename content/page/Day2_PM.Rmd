# Guess Who! _Star Wars edition_ {-}
<br>

![](../images/guess-who-game.jpg){width="350" align="right" style="margin-top: -20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 36px;"}

> Are you the best Jedi detective out there? Let's play a game to find out. In the past day and a half, we have learned a lot of the `dplyr` functions. Guess what else comes with the `dplyr` package? A **Star Wars data set**!

<br>

Open the data set now by completing the following steps:

1. First, load the `dplyr` package from your `library()`
1. Second, pull the Star Wars dataset into your environment.
    - I'm very literal so I named the data: **starwars_guess_who**
<br><br>
```{r, echo = T, eval = T}

library(dplyr)

starwars_guess_who <- starwars
```

<br>

### The rules  {-}

1. Scroll through the Star Wars dataset and find a character you find interesting.
   - Or run `sample_n(starwars, 1)` to choose your character at random.
1. __Don't let your neighbor see the character you chose.__
1. Take turns asking each other questions about your neighbor's Star Wars character. 
1. Use the answers to build a `filter()` function and narrow down the potential character your neighbor may have picked. 
1. _Elusive_ answers are encouraged.
    - For example, if someone asks: _What is your character's mass?_ 
    - You can respond: _My character's mass is equal to one less than their age._ 
    - If you're feeling generous you can give a more straight forward answer such as: _My character's mass is definitely more than 100 and less that 140._
1. Sometimes a character will not have a specific attribute. We learned earlier how R stores nulls as `NA`. So, some of your filter statements might be `is.na(hair_color)` or `is.na(mass)`. 

<span class="btn_code_green"> __WINNER!__ </span>

- The winner is the first to guess their neighbor's character.


Here's a `filter()` statement that subsets the data to the character _Plo Koon_.

```{r, eval = F}
mr_koon <- filter(starwars,
                  mass       < 100,
                  eye_color  != "blue",
                  gender     == "male",
                  homeworld  == "Dorin",
                  birth_year > 20)

```

<span class="h6" style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold;"> The 3 ingredients in a `ggplot` </span>


### 1. The base plot {-}
```{r, echo = F}
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r, echo = F}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

# Read in the conversion data
convert_url <- "https://itep-r.netlify.com/data/conversion_table.csv"

convert <- read_csv(convert_url)

# Read in scrap data
scrap <- read_csv("https://itep-r.netlify.com/data/starwars_scrap_jakku_full.csv")

# Join the scrap to the conversion table
scrap <- left_join(scrap, convert)

# Calculate the number of credits
scrap <- scrap %>% 
         mutate(credits = amount * pounds * price_per_pound)

```

```{r, echo = T, eval = T}
ggplot(scrap)
```

<br>

> Note when we load the package it's `library ("ggplot2")`, but the function to make a plot is `ggplot(scrap)`. We admit, it is a bit silly.


### 2. The the X, Y _aesthetics_  {-}

The _aesthetics_ assign the components from the data that you want to use in the chart. These also determine the dimensions of the plot.

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = destination, y = credits)) 
```


### 3. The layers or _geometries_  {-}
```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = destination, y = credits)) + geom_point()
```

<br>


#### <i class="fa fa-cogs" aria-hidden="true" style="color: green"></i> Exercise {-}

Try making a scatterplot of any two columns.

_Hint: Numeric variables will be more informative._

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = __column1__, y = __column2__)) + geom_point()
```

## Colors {-}
<hr>


Now let's use color to show the origins of the scrap
```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = destination, y = credits, color = origin)) +
  geom_point()
```


<br>

This is a **A LOT** of detail. Let's make a bar chart and add up the sales to make it easier to understand.

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = destination, y = credits, fill = origin)) + geom_bar(stat = "sum")
```

<br>

This is the same as `geom_col()`.
```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = destination, y = credits, fill = origin)) + geom_col()
```

<br>

<div class="data">
#### What if we want to make it easier to compare sales by origin? Let's change the position. {-}
</div>

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = destination, y = credits, fill = origin)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "sum", position = "dodge")
```


# Homeworld training {-}

![](../images/porg.png){style="float: right; margin-top: -10px;"}

1. Load one of the data sets below into R
    - Porg contamination on Ahch-To: "https://itep-r.netlify.com/data/porg_samples.csv"
    - Planet Endor air samples: "https://itep-r.netlify.com/data/air_endor.csv"
    - Or use data from a recent project of yours  

<br>
  
2. Create 2 plots using the data. 
3. _Don't worry if it looks_ __really weird__. _Consider it art and try again._  



### <i class="fa fa-user-astronaut" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#040707;"></i> Pro-tip! {-}

<div class="note">

When you add more layers using `+` remember to place it at the end of each line.

```{r, eval=F}
# This will work
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = credits)) +
  geom_point()

# So will this
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = credits)) + geom_point()

# But this won't
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = credits))
  + geom_point()

```

</div>



# | More Plots

## Colors {-}
<hr>

Now let's use color to show the destinations of the scrap.


```{r, eval=T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = credits, color = destination)) +
  geom_point()
```

<br>

### <i class="fa fa-user-astronaut" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#040707;"></i> Pro-tip! {-}
<div class="well">

An easy way to experiment with colors is to add layers like `scale_fill_brewer` or `scale_colour_brewer` to your plot which will link to RcolorBrewer palettes so you can have accessible color schemes.

</div>

## Bar charts {-}

This is a too much detail. Let's make a bar chart and add up the sales to make it easier to understand. Note that we use `fill=` inside `aes()` instead of `color=`. If we use color, we get a colorful outline and grey (or gray) bars.


```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = credits, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col()
```

<br>

What if we want to make it easier to compare sales by destination for each origin? Let's change the position of the bars. Remember, you can use `help(geom_col)` to learn about different options for the function. You can do the same with any other `ggplot2` function.


```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = credits, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```


## Facet wrap {-}

What if we want to make the chart less crowded? Let's use the `facet wrap` function to put each origin on a separate chart.

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = origin, y = credits, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap("destination")
```



## Themes {-}

You may not like the appearance of these plots. `ggplot2` uses `theme` functions to change the appearance of a plot. Try some different themes out.

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = origin, y = total_price, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap("destination") +
  theme_bw()
```


## Labels {-}

You can also change the axis and title labels using the `labs` function.

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = origin, y = total_price, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap("destination") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Scrap sales by origin and destination", 
       x     = "Origin", 
       y     = "Total sales")
```


## Drop `2.2e+06` scientific notation {-}

Want to get rid of that ugly scientific notation? We can use `options(scipen = 999)`. Note that this is a general setting in R and not part of `ggplot`. Once you use `options(scipen = 999)` in your current session, you don't have to use it again (like loading a package, you only need to run the line once when you start a new R session).


```{r, eval = F}
options(scipen = 999)

ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = origin, y = total_price, fill = destination)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap("destination") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Scrap sales by origin and destination", 
       x     = "Origin", 
       y     = "Total sales")
```

<br>

<div class="data">
#### CHALLENGE {-}

What if we don't like the zeros and want the labels to be in millions of credits? Any ideas?
</div>

<br>


#### <i class="fa fa-cogs" aria-hidden="true" style="color: green"></i> Exercise {-}

We've covered how to do a scatterplot with `geom_point` and a bar chart with `geom_col`, but now we want to do a boxplot of the total price for each destination. But we're not telling you which function to use. You're on your own here. Feel free to add colors ,`facet_wrap`, `theme`, and `labs` to your boxplots. May the force be with you.


## Save plots {-}

You've hopefully made some plots you're proud of, so let's learn to save them so we can cherish them forever. There's a function called `ggsave` to do just that. How do we `ggsave` our plots? HELP! Let's type `help(ggsave)`.

```{r ggsave, eval = F}
# Get help
help(ggsave)
?ggsave

# Copy and paste the r code of your favorite plot here
ggplot(data, aes()) +
   .... +
   ....


# Save your plot to a png file of your choosing
ggsave("your_results_folder/plot_name.png")
```


<br>


### <i class="fa fa-user-astronaut" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#040707;"></i> Pro-tip! {-}
<div class="note">

What if you don't want to save just the last plot you've made? Instead, you want to make a plot and save it for later. Give your plot a name!

```{r ggsave-objects, eval = F}

# The ggplot you want to save
my_plot <- ggplot(...)
  
# The name of the file the chart will be saved to.
where_to_save_it <- "___.png"

# Save it!
ggsave(filename = where_to_save_it, plot = my_plot)
```

# Plot Questions {-}

<div style="font-size: 16px;">

- How to modify the gridlines behind your chart?
    - Try the different themes at the end of this lesson: `theme_light()` or `theme_bw()`
    - Or modify the color and size with `theme(panel.grid.minor = element_line(colour = "white", size = 0.5))`
    - There's even `theme_excel()`
- How do you set the x and y scale manually?
    - Here is an example with a scatter plot: `ggplot() + geom_point() + xlim(beginning, end) + ylim(beginning, end)`
    - __Warning:__ Values above or below the limits you set will not be shown. This is another great way to lie with data. 
- How do you get rid of the legend if you don't need it?
    - `geom_point(aes(color = facility_name), show.legend = FALSE)`
    - The [R Cookbook](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Legends_(ggplot2)/) shows a number of ways to get rid of legends.
- I only like dashed lines. How do you change the linetype to a _dashed_ line? 
    - `geom_line(aes(color = facility_name), linetype = "dashed")`
    - You can also try `"dotted"` and `"dotdash"`, or even`"twodash"`
  
- How many colors are there in R? How does R know `hotpink` is a color?
    - There is an [R color cheatsheet](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~frazier/RSpatialGuides/colorPaletteCheatsheet.pdf)  
    - As well as a list of [R color names](http://www.r-graph-gallery.com/42-colors-names/)
    - `library(viridis)` provides some great default color palettes for charts and maps.
    - This [Color web tool](http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3) has palette ideas and color codes you can use in your plots
- Keyboard shortcuts for RStudio
    - There is a [Shortcut cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf)
