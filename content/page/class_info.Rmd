This 3-day series teaches the basics of importing data, using new packages, cleaning and summarizing data with tidy tools, and using `R` to make charts, maps, and other graphics. Examples include tribal data, with a focus on reporting and analyzing for trend analyses and evaluating data for outliers and potential exceptional events.

No previous experience with R is required. However, this is a hands-on course and is geared towards those actively gathering or analyzing data. If you have questions regarding your eligibility for this course, please contact Melinda Ronca-Battista at melinda.ronca-battista@nau.edu.
