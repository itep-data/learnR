Join us for this 3-day series to learn the basics of importing data, using new packages, cleaning and summarizing data with tidy tools, and using R to make charts, maps, and other graphics. Besides Star Wars, examples will include tribal environmental data, with a focus on reporting trend analyses and evaluating outliers and potential exceptional events.

No previous experience in R is required. However, this is a hands-on course geared towards those actively gathering or analyzing data (or those that want to be!). If you have any questions regarding your eligibility for this course, please contact Melinda Ronca-Battista at melinda.ronca-battista@nau.edu.
