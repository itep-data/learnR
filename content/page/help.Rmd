## Troubleshooting

These are a few of the things we personally forget to do all the time and cause 90% of our errors. They're good first checks if R starts throwing errors or behaving strangely.
  
- Make sure all parentheses are balanced so that every opening `(` has a corresponding closing `)`.
- R doesn't love `\` backward slashes like _Windows_, check that they didn't sneak into your expression somewhere. When in doubt use the `/` forward slash.
- If you think you have completed typing your code, and instead of seeing the `>` command prompt at the console you see the `+` character instead. That's a good sign that either R is still thinking very-very hard, or it is still waiting for you to complete your expression. You can hit `Esc` or `Ctrl-C` to force your way back to the console and try typing your code again. 
- In `ggplot` we build up plots one piece at a time by adding expressions to one another with the `+` character. When doing this, make sure the `+` goes at the end of each line, and not the beginning. 


Put the `+` sign here to make `ggplot` happy:

```{r trouble_gg1, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
    geom_point()
```

Put it on the next line to make `ggplot` sad:

```{r trouble_gg2, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
  + geom_point()
```

## Error messages

Not all error messages are helpful or easy to interpret, but they do seem to be getting better in many R packages. When googling an error message it can help to put the entire message in quotes. For the error below we would search for `"Error in fit[5, 100, ] : subscript out of bounds"`.

<div align="center" style="margin-top: 24px;">
