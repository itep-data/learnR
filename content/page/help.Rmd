## Troubleshooting

- Get function help inside R: `?arrange()` 

Here are few things we forget to do all the time and are good first things to check for when you run into problems.
  
- Make sure all parentheses are balanced so that every opening "`(`" has a corresponding closing "`)`".
- Be sure you complete your expressions. If you think you have completed typing your code, but instead of seeing the `>` command prompt at the console you see the `+` character instead, then either R is still thinking or it is still waiting for you to complete your expression. You can hit `Esc` or `Ctrl-C` to force your way back to the console and try typing your code again. 
- In `ggplot` we build up plots a piece at a time by adding expressions to one another. When doing this, make sure the `+` character goes at the end of each line, and not the beginning. 
- R doesn't love `\` backward slashes like _Windows_, check that they didn't sneak into your expression somewhere. When in doubt use the `/` forward slash.
  

This makes `ggplot` happy:

```{r trouble_gg1, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
    geom_point()
```

This makes `ggplot` sad:

```{r trouble_gg2, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
+ geom_point()
```
