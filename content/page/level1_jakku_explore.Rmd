Use _mutate()_ to make a column that reports "buy" if the item is a `hyperdrive` and "ignore" if the item is a `proximity sensor`. Call this new column `do_this`. You will need both _ifelse()_ and _mutate()_ for this task.

> Let's take a closer look at our full dataset now (clean_scrap). We want to give the Junk Boss a summary of all of this data. He doesn't have the patience to really look at a lot of data. He hates numbers! He likes money. He wants to know the following things: 

> 1. The sum of all the money potentially earned by item.
> 1. The maximum money potentially earned by item.
> 1. The number of reports of each item.
> 1. The 35th percentile of the price by item. 

**[We don't even know how he learned about "quantile", we are pretty sure someone told him about this just to test our abilities. If we don't provide this summarized dataset, Unkar Plutt is likely going to shoot us into space rendering us...dead. We don't want that. Let's make a summary table.]**

<br>
<br>
<details>
<summary class = "btn_code_green"> **Hint: ** </summary>

You will need the pipe `%>%`, `group_by()`, `summarise()`, `sum()`, `max()`, `quantile()`, and `n()`.

> Oh boy, old Unkar just learned about plots. What will he want next? He wants a plot of the maximum total prices by item. We must create this plot or perish. Try both geom_col() and geom_point(0) to see which make a more simple look at the price maxima.
