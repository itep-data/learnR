<h1 style="margin-top:-5px;"> Welcome to Jakku! </h1>
<hr>

You are BB8 and you've arrived to just in time. Rey needs your help!

The Junk boss Unkar is up to no-good once again and Rey needs some parts to repair a starship. With your help she can escape Jakku and join forces with the New Republic. 

Lucky for Rey, you just snagged a transfer log from Unkar’s droid showing a list of recent scrap shipments. Our goal is to make some trouble for Unkar and track down those ship parts Rey needs while we're at it. 


## Blast off!
